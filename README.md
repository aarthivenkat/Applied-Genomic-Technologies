# Applied Genomic Technologies
In Applied Genomic Technologies, we performed weekly literature review and examine the state of bioinformatics, from wbole genome sequencing to current technologies to infer DNA/RNA interaction. Our final project reviewed machine learning applications in genomics and the trend towards predictive modeling for large, complex, and high-dimensional datasets.
